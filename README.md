# Cookbook Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the Cookbook application, an online forum for sharing recipes. It is built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm (version 6 or above)
- ES6 supported web browser

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
